# overseas

Overseas was a project in which our goal was to create a solution to encourage students to track their learning and increase their self-awareness of progress and growth.

Looking for a way to reconcile this management with learning methods such as Bloom's taxonomy, and Self-regulated learning, we developed Prisma.

## Prisma

Prisma is an iPadOS app built to help people better follow their academic and personal development, through guided reflections and revisiting your learning, writing down your discoveries daily, and building a new perception of knowledge.
